## Task 1: Comparing GNSS Techniques for Smartphone Navigation: DGNSS, RTK, PPP, and PPP-RTK
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have become indispensable for smartphone navigation, enabling applications from ride-hailing to location-based services. However, achieving high accuracy in diverse environments remains challenging. This essay evaluates four advanced GNSS techniques—Differential GNSS (DGNSS), Real-Time Kinematic (RTK), Precise Point Positioning (PPP), and PPP-RTK—highlighting their pros and cons for smartphone use.

### Differential GNSS (DGNSS)

DGNSS is a technique that improves the accuracy of GNSS by using a network of fixed ground-based reference stations. These stations receive GNSS signals and calculate corrections based on known positions, which are then transmitted to the user's receiver to correct its position.

Pros:
DGNSS improves upon standalone GNSS by using a fixed base station to broadcast error corrections (e.g., atmospheric delays, satellite clock errors) to nearby receivers. This **reduces position errors** to meter-level accuracy (1–3 meters), sufficient for most consumer apps. Its simplicity and reliance on existing infrastructure, such as Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) like WAAS, make it **cost-effective** and **widely accessible**.

Cons:
**Accuracy diminishes with distance from the base station (typically <100 km). Coverage gaps occur in remote areas without base stations**. Additionally, smartphones may **lack dedicated hardware** to receive traditional DGNSS signals (e.g., radio beacons), often relying on internet-based corrections, which introduces latency and connectivity dependency. The transmission of correction data can introduce **latency**, which may affect real-time applications.

### Real-Time Kinematic (RTK)

RTK is a technique that provides high-precision positioning by using carrier phase measurements of the GNSS signals. It requires a base station and a rover, with the base station sending corrections to the rover in real-time.

Pros:
RTK leverages carrier-phase measurements and a nearby base station (<20 km) to achieve **centimeter-level accuracy** in real time. This precision benefits applications like augmented reality and drone navigation. Modern smartphones with dual-frequency GNSS chips (e.g., GPS L5, Galileo E5) can now support RTK, enhancing their utility. In addition, the **real-time nature** of RTK makes it suitable for dynamic applications where immediate feedback is crucial.

Cons:
RTK’s reliance on short baselines **limits coverage** to areas with dense base station networks. Urban canyons and obstructions cause signal **multipath, degrading accuracy**. **Maintaining a stable data connection for corrections is challenging** in low-coverage zones, and deploying base stations is infrastructure-intensive, hindering scalability.

### Precise Point Positioning (PPP)

PPP is a GNSS technique that provides precise positioning using a single receiver by applying corrections for satellite clock and orbit errors, atmospheric delays, and other factors.

Pros:
PPP **eliminates the need for base stations** by using precise satellite orbit and clock data, often accessed via the internet. It offers **global coverage** and **decimeter- to centimeter-level accuracy** after a convergence period (~30 minutes). This makes PPP ideal for regions lacking ground infrastructure.

Cons:
**Long convergence times** frustrate real-time use cases like turn-by-turn navigation. **Computational demands** for processing precise data strain smartphone batteries. PPP also requires **uninterrupted internet access**, which is unreliable in remote or congested areas.

### PPP-RTK

PPP-RTK combines elements of both PPP and RTK, using precise satellite orbit and clock data along with local corrections to achieve high accuracy with faster convergence times.

Pros:
PPP-RTK merges PPP’s global corrections with RTK’s rapid convergence. By integrating network-derived atmospheric models, it achieves **centimeter accuracy** within minutes, even **without nearby base stations**. This hybrid approach is **scalable**, relying on regional or global correction services (e.g., commercial networks like Trimble RTX).

Cons:
**Implementation complexity and reliance on correction networks** limit current accessibility. Like PPP and RTK, it **demands continuous internet connectivity and advanced smartphone hardware**. While promising, **infrastructure for PPP-RTK remains under development**, restricting its practicality.

### Smartphone-Specific Considerations

**Hardware**: Newer smartphones support multi-frequency GNSS, enabling RTK and PPP-RTK. However, processing PPP corrections may drain batteries faster.

**Connectivity**: RTK and PPP-RTK require stable data links, posing challenges in rural or data-congested areas. DGNSS and PPP are more forgiving but depend on correction availability.

**Environment**: Urban areas degrade RTK performance due to multipath, whereas PPP and PPP-RTK are less affected but suffer from signal blockages.

**Cost and Infrastructure**: RTK’s base stations are expensive to deploy, while PPP-RTK’s viability hinges on expanding correction services. DGNSS and PPP leverage existing systems, offering lower barriers.

### Comparison Table

| Technique   | Accuracy   | Coverage   | Real-Time Capability | Hardware Requirements| Suitability for Smartphones| 
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| DGNSS	 | Sub-meter | Limited to station range | Moderate| Standard GNSS receiver| High for general navigation|
| RTK |Centimeter| Limited to base station networks| High |Dual-frequency receiver| Low for current smartphone hardware| 
|PPP | Decimeter to sub-meter| Global| 	Low| Dual-frequency receiver| Moderate for static or low-dynamic uses|
|PPP-RTK |Centimeter | Global with regional augmentation |High |Dual-frequency receiver | Promising but currently limited |


### Conclusion
For current smartphone navigation, DGNSS and PPP strike a balance between accuracy and accessibility, though they lag in precision. RTK excels in specialized, high-accuracy scenarios but is constrained by infrastructure. PPP-RTK emerges as the most promising future technique, blending global coverage with rapid convergence, contingent on broader correction networks and enhanced smartphone capabilities. As dual-frequency GNSS adoption grows and 5G connectivity expands, PPP-RTK could redefine mobile navigation, marrying high accuracy with scalability for mainstream use.

## Task 2: GNSS in Urban Areas

### code explaination and Result

The provided skymask can be utilized to identify whether the line-of-sight (LOS) signal from a satellite is obstructed. The skymask depicting the building boundary and the corresponding blocked satellites is illustrated below:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0000ca8a-64f0-48d3-abfe-2f33725523b5)

**Anlysis**

This zenith map highlights the relationship between satellite visibility and environmental obstructions, shedding light on key issues in satellite signal reliability and classification:

1. Impact of Obstructions on Signal Reception:
The map demonstrates how local obstacles, such as buildings or terrain, restrict the visibility of satellites. Satellites outside the visible sky region (defined by the zenith angle boundary) are likely to experience signal blockages, leading to Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions. This emphasizes the need to account for environmental factors when designing or analyzing satellite-based positioning systems.

2. Classification Accuracy of LOS/NLOS Signals:
The map helps assess whether satellites are correctly classified as Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS). Misclassifications can occur if the obstruction model (sky mask) or satellite signal quality is poorly understood. Incorrect LOS classification for obstructed satellites can lead to significant positioning errors due to multipath effects or signal degradation.

3. Importance of Sky Mask Models:
The visible sky boundary (sky mask) is essential for determining which satellites can provide reliable signals. The map illustrates scenarios where either the sky mask or satellite classification needs refinement to better match real-world conditions.

The code is modified in Skymask_test.m and leastSquarePos.m

```markdown
```matlab
% Compare satellite elevation with building elevation
is_visible = el_sat(:,end) > building_el_at_sat; % logical array

% Find visible and blocked satellites
% visible_sat_idx = find(is_visible);
blocked_sat_idx = find(~is_visible);

visible_sat_idx = find(is_visible);
```

```markdown
```matlab
[az(i), el(i), ~] = topocent(pos(1:3, :), Rot_X - pos(1:3, :));
% Determine whether it is blocked by skymask
if isBlockedBySkyMask(az(i), el(i), skymask)
    % Jump over the blocked satellite
    continue;
end
```

The traditional elevation angle weighted least square positioning results are shown below:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4c1c20c-39c9-4e87-a4ae-54ff2d655b64)

The skymask based weighted least square positioning results are shown below:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9b345b5-acfb-46fd-9553-ac4e79e1ce09)


**Anlysis**

These two sets of results compare the performance of a traditional elevation angle weighted least square method and a sky mask-based weighted least square method in GNSS positioning. The primary difference lies in the handling of satellite visibility and its effect on positioning accuracy and reliability.

1. Coordinate Variations (E, N, U):

The first method (traditional weighting) shows less consistent variations in the East (E) and Up (U) components, with significant deviations, especially in the vertical direction. This indicates potential contamination from Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) signals or poor satellite geometry.
The sky mask-based method significantly reduces the variations, especially in the Up (U) component. This improvement suggests that the sky mask effectively filters out NLOS satellites, leading to more stable positioning.

2. Mean Position Accuracy:

In the 3D plots, the traditional method's mean position is closer to the true position (lower height deviation), but the dispersion of measurements is wider.
The sky mask-based method shows a higher vertical offset in the mean position but achieves tighter clustering of measurements, indicating improved consistency.

3. Sky Plot and PDOP:

Both methods share the same PDOP (6.2278), suggesting identical satellite geometry. However, the sky mask-based method likely excludes obstructed satellites, improving the quality of the solution despite the same PDOP.

## Task 3: GPS RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring)
### Introduction

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have become indispensable for modern positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) applications, ranging from aviation to autonomous vehicles. However, the reliability of GNSS measurements is frequently compromised by signal anomalies such as satellite clock failures, atmospheric disturbances, or multipath effects in urban environments. These errors, if undetected, can lead to hazardous positioning inaccuracies—a critical concern for safety-of-life systems like aircraft landing or surgical drone operations. To address this challenge, Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) has emerged as a foundational technology for ensuring GNSS data integrity. By leveraging redundant satellite measurements and statistical algorithms, RAIM autonomously detects and isolates faulty signals in real time, enabling receivers to exclude corrupted data and maintain robust positioning performance. Initially standardized for aviation in the 1990s, RAIM has evolved to incorporate advanced variants such as weighted RAIM and multi-constellation RAIM, achieving fault detection probabilities exceeding 99.9% in recent implementations. This paper explores the principles, advancements, and practical limitations of RAIM, highlighting its pivotal role in bridging the gap between GNSS ubiquity and operational safety.

### code explaination

1. RAIM

RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring) ensures the reliability of GPS positioning by detecting and isolating faulty satellite signals. The provided code demonstrates RAIM's functionality within the positioning process.

- Fault Detection: The function raim_detection is called to evaluate the consistency of satellite measurements. It uses the design matrix (A), the observed-minus-computed residuals (omc), and the covariance matrix (C) to determine if there is a fault (is_fault) and identifies the faulty satellite (excluded_idx).

```markdown
```matlab
[is_fault, excluded_idx] = raim_detection(A, navSolutions.omc(:, currMeasNr), diag(C), settings);
```

- Fault Isolation and Recalculation: If a fault is detected and at least four satellites remain (nmbOfSatellites - 1 >= 4), the faulty satellite is removed from the position computation. The corresponding satellite's position and pseudorange correction (clkCorrRawP) are eliminated. The position solution is recalculated using the remaining satellites by calling leastSquarePos.

```markdown
```matlab
satPositions(:, excluded_idx) = [];
clkCorrRawP(excluded_idx) = [];
[xyzdt, ~, ~, ~, navSolutions.is_fault(:, currMeasNr), ~, ~, ~] = ...
    leastSquarePos(satPositions, clkCorrRawP, settings);
```

- Position Integrity Monitoring: The RAIM process ensures that the final position solution is computed using only reliable satellite signals. Faulty measurements are flagged (navSolutions.is_fault) to maintain positioning integrity.

```markdown
```matlab
--- Apply position update --------------------------------------------
        
           %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% RAIM insert %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
            [is_fault, excluded_idx] = raim_detection(A, navSolutions.omc(:, currMeasNr), diag(C), settings);

            if is_fault == 1
                navSolutions.is_fault(:, currMeasNr) = 1;
            end

            nmbOfSatellites = size(satPositions, 2);

            if is_fault && (nmbOfSatellites - 1 >= 4)  % Ensure that the remaining number of satellites is ≥ 4
                % Reinitialize the data after eliminating the faulty satellite
                satPositions(:, excluded_idx) = [];
                clkCorrRawP(excluded_idx) = [];

                [xyzdt,~, ...
                    ~, ...
                    ~,navSolutions.is_fault(:, currMeasNr),~,~,~] =...
                    leastSquarePos(satPositions, clkCorrRawP, settings);
            end
            navSolutions.sdsd(:, currMeasNr) = excluded_idx;
```

2. Chi-square detection

The code snippet demonstrates the use of a chi-square-based fault detection mechanism for navigation systems. This method is essential in Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) to identify and mitigate faulty satellite signals.

The threshold is calculated using the chi-square inverse cumulative distribution function (chi2inv), scaled by the variance of measurement errors. This threshold ensures that faults beyond the normal noise level trigger detection. For the given parameters, threshold is about 82.89. The chi-square test compares residual errors (observed minus computed values) with this threshold. If the residuals exceed threshold, the system flags a fault. The PL calculation solves for the error bound ensuring the probability of missed detection (P_md = 1e-7) is satisfied.

```markdown
```matlab
function [T_threshold,PL] = chi()
    P_fa = 1e-2;      
    sigma = 3;         
    n_sat = 5;        
    dof = n_sat - 4;   
    T_threshold = chi2inv(1 - P_fa, dof) * sigma^2; % ≈ 82.89
    fprintf('T_threshold = %.2f meters\n', T_threshold);
    P_md = 1e-7;    
    fun = @(PL) ncx2cdf(T_threshold, dof, PL.^2 / sigma^2) - (1 - P_md);
    PL_guess = 50; 
    PL = fzero(fun, PL_guess); 
    fprintf('3D Protection Level = %.2f meters\n', PL);
end
```

3. computing PL

The second code snippet elaborates on the Protection Level (PL) calculation in the context of weighted least squares (WLS) and integrity monitoring. Here, the PL is derived using satellite geometry, residual errors, and statistical thresholds.

- Weighted Residual Analysis: The weighted sum of squared errors (WSSE) is computed to evaluate the residual consistency `WSSE_sqrt = sqrt(y' * W * (I - P) * y);`.
- The slope of each satellite's contribution to the protection level is calculated by `SLPOE = sqrt((S(1,:).^2 + S(2,:).^2 + S(3,:).^2) ./ (1 - diag(P)'));`.
- The Protection Level (PL) is computed by combining the second-largest slope, the detection threshold, and the missed detection margin is `PL = SLP(2) * T_threshold + K_md * sigma;`.

The PL represents the maximum tolerable vertical error, ensuring that the probability of missed detection remains within acceptable limits. It accounts for satellite geometry and statistical thresholds to provide a robust safety margin.

```markdown
```matlab
PL = 1;
WSSE_sqrt = 1;
T_threshold = 1;
    Nr_sat = 5;
    I = eye(Nr_sat);   
    isolation_mat = ones(Nr_sat, 1);
    I = I * diag(isolation_mat);
    y = omc;
    S = inv(A'*C*A)*(A'*C);
    P = A*S;
    W = C;
    WSSE_sqrt = sqrt(y'*W*(I-P)*y);
    SLPOE = sqrt((S(1,:).^2+S(2,:).^2+S(3,:).^2)./(1-diag(P)'));
    SSE = omc' * C *omc;
    P_fa = 1e-2;      
    n_satellites = 5;   
    dof = n_satellites - 4; 
    T_threshold = sqrt(chi2inv(1 - P_fa, dof));
    P_md = 1e-7;              
    K_md = norminv(1 - P_md); 
    sigma = 3;
    K = S;
    for i = 1 : Nr_sat
    % OLS
     Pslope(i) = sqrt(sum((K(1:3,i)).^2)) * sqrt(Nr_sat-4) / sqrt(1-P(i,i)); 
    % WLS
     %Pslope(i) = sqrt(sum((K(1:3,i)).^2)) * sqrt(1/W(i,i)) / sqrt(1-P(i,i));
    end
    SLP = sort(Pslope,'descend');
    PL = SLP(2) * T_threshold +  K_md * sigma;
```

### Results and Analysis

This chart is a Stanford Integrity Diagram used to analyze the performance of a navigation system in terms of vertical position error (VPE) and vertical protection level (VPL). The analysis evaluates the system's ability to maintain integrity while ensuring that the position error does not exceed a predefined alert limit (AL). Below is a breakdown of the key elements in the chart:

Horizontal Line at AL = 50.0 m marks the alert limit (AL). If the VPL exceeds this threshold, the system should alert the user because the integrity cannot be guaranteed. Diagonal Line (VPE = VPL) divides the chart into two regions:
1) Below the line: The VPL overestimates the actual VPE, which is safe for integrity.
2) Above the line: The VPL underestimates the VPE, which is a dangerous condition as the actual error exceeds the protection level.

In this figure, Most data points lie below the AL = 50.0 m horizontal line, indicating that the system maintains integrity in these cases. A few data points are near or slightly below the diagonal (VPE = VPL). This suggests that the system closely estimates the actual VPE, though it remains safe. The chart includes an annotation for probabilities, which represent the false alarm and missed detection probabilities, respectively. These values are critical for defining the detection thresholds and integrity limits.

## Task 4: LEO Satellites for Navigation

Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, operating at altitudes of 500–2,000 km, have revolutionized global communications with low-latency data transmission. However, their application in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) introduces multifaceted technical and operational hurdles. This essay examines the challenges of integrating LEO satellites into navigation frameworks, focusing on orbital dynamics, signal propagation, infrastructure demands, and system compatibility.

### Orbital Dynamics and Coverage Limitations
The defining characteristic of LEO satellites—their rapid orbital velocity—poses a dual challenge. Unlike Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites (e.g., GPS, Galileo) with 12-hour orbital periods, LEO satellites complete an orbit in 90–120 minutes. Consequently, a single LEO satellite remains visible from a ground location for only 10–15 minutes, necessitating constellations of hundreds to thousands of satellites for uninterrupted coverage. For context, while GPS operates with 24 MEO satellites, proposed LEO navigation systems like China’s LEO-PNT plan to deploy 300–400 satellites, escalating deployment costs and space traffic risks.

Additionally, the satellites’ velocity of ~7.8 km/s induces extreme Doppler shifts (~±50 kHz at L-band frequencies), requiring advanced receiver algorithms to correct signal distortions. Traditional GNSS receivers, designed for MEO Doppler shifts of ±5 kHz, struggle to adapt without hardware upgrades, complicating user equipment design.

### Signal Propagation and Atmospheric Interference
LEO satellites transmit stronger signals due to shorter path loss (e.g., ~30 dB advantage over MEO at 1,200 km altitude). However, lower orbits amplify atmospheric impacts:

1. **Ionospheric delays:** LEO signals traverse denser plasma layers near the ionospheric F2 peak (~350 km), increasing delay variability. Dual-frequency corrections, standard in GNSS, become less effective due to steeper incidence angles.
2. **Tropospheric effects:** Signals pass through 90% of the troposphere’s water vapor content, exacerbating weather-related delays.

Moreover, LEO navigation signals often share bands with communication systems (e.g., Starlink’s 10.7–12.7 GHz downlinks), risking interference. Mitigation demands spectrally efficient waveforms and cognitive radio techniques, yet these remain experimental in mass-market receivers.

### Infrastructure and Economic Viability
LEO navigation systems demand unprecedented infrastructure investments:

1. **Constellation deployment:** Launching megaconstellations incurs staggering costs. SpaceX’s Starlink, a communication-focused LEO network, required $10 billion for 4,000 satellites—a benchmark suggesting navigation-focused systems could exceed $20 billion.
2. **Ground segment complexity:** Unlike MEO systems relying on ~20 globally distributed ground stations, LEO networks need hundreds of monitoring stations for precise orbit determination and time synchronization.
3. **Operational lifespan:** Atmospheric drag at LEO altitudes limits satellite lifetimes to 5–7 years (vs. 15 years for MEO), necessitating frequent replenishment launches. Collision risks with space debris further elevate operational costs.

### Integration with Legacy GNSS Architectures
Synergizing LEO signals with existing GNSS (GPS, Galileo, etc.) faces technical and regulatory barriers:

1. **Receiver redesign:** Current GNSS chipsets lack LEO-specific Doppler compensation modules. While Qualcomm’s 2023 Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 introduced preliminary LEO support, widespread adoption requires industry-wide standardization.
2. **Signal interoperability:** LEO navigation signals must conform to ITU Radio Regulations and GNSS spectrum allocations. For example, China’s LEO-PNT uses the 1,561–1,591 MHz band, overlapping with Galileo’s E1, necessitating interference mitigation agreements.

Time synchronization: Achieving nanosecond-level timing across fast-moving LEO constellations requires inter-satellite links (ISLs) and atomic clocks resistant to relativistic effects—a capability yet to be proven at scale.

### Conclusion
LEO satellites hold transformative potential for GNSS, promising enhanced urban canyon coverage and sub-meter accuracy through geometry-diverse signals. However, realizing this vision demands breakthroughs in low-cost satellite production, AI-driven signal processing, and international spectrum coordination. Projects like the FAA’s L5-band integration trials and ESA’s Moonlight initiative highlight incremental progress, but commercial viability remains a decade away. As megaconstellations mature, LEO-GNSS could evolve from a supplemental system to a cornerstone of 6G-era navigation—provided the technical, economic, and geopolitical challenges are decisively addressed.

## Task 5: GNSS Remote Sensing

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), initially designed for positioning and navigation, have evolved into versatile tools for Earth observation. Among their emerging applications, GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) stands out as a groundbreaking technique that repurposes reflected GNSS signals to monitor terrestrial and oceanic surfaces. This essay examines the transformative role of GNSS-R in remote sensing, focusing on its principles, applications in environmental monitoring, and contributions to climate science.

### Principles of GNSS Reflectometry
GNSS-R leverages signals from navigation satellites (e.g., GPS, Galileo) that reflect off Earth’s surface and are captured by specialized receivers. Unlike conventional remote sensing systems that rely on dedicated transmitters, GNSS-R operates passively, utilizing the following signal components:

1. **Direct Signal:** Line-of-sight transmission from the satellite.
2. **Reflected Signal:** Scattered off land, ocean, or ice surfaces.

By analyzing the interference patterns between direct and reflected signals, GNSS-R retrieves geophysical parameters through:

1. **Delay-Doppler Maps (DDMs):** Capturing time delays and frequency shifts caused by surface roughness.
2. **Polarimetric Analysis:** Measuring polarization changes (e.g., right-hand to left-hand circular polarization) to infer surface dielectric properties.
3. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** Correlating SNR fluctuations with surface characteristics like soil moisture.
   
Key advantages over active radar systems:
| Parameter   | GNSS-R   | Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)   | 
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Cost	 | Low (no transmitter) | High (dedicated platform) |
| Revisit time | Minutes (multi-constellation)| Days to weeks| 
|Spatial resolution | 0.5–25 km| Global| 	1–100 m|
|Power consumption|<10 W | >500 W |
